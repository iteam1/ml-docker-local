# ml-docker-full-service
build docker container ml-model for EEG data, include training and prediction

The idea is to do a quick and easy build of a Docker container with a simple machine learning model and run it. In order to start building a Docker container for a machine learning model, letâ€™s consider three files:

-	Dockerfile
-	train.py
-	inference.py

The train.py is  a python script that ingest and normalize EEG data in a csv file (train.csv) and train two models to classify the data (using scikit-learn). The script saves two models: Linear Discriminant Analysis (clf_lda) and Neural Networks multi-layer perceptron (clf_NN).

The inference.py will be called to perform batch inference by loading the two models that has been previously created. The application will normalize new EEG data coming from a csv file (test.csv), perform inference on the dataset and print the classification accuracy and predictions.


# quick-start

- run train model: `python3 train.py`
- run train model and log print out: `python train.py > log.txt`
- run inference and log result: `python inference.py > inference.txt`
- build image `sudo docker build -t app:0.1 .`
- run container map-port and volume: `sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD:/app --name con app:0.1`
- run container with specific command `sudo docker exec con python3 inference.py`

# packages

- install `numpy`: `pip3 install numpy`
- install `scipy`: `pip3 install scipy`
- install `sklearn`: `pip3 install scikit-learn`
- install `pandas`: `pip3 install pandas`

# build docker image

    FROM jupyter/scipy-notebook
    WORKDIR /app
    RUN pip install joblib
    COPY . /app
    RUN bash

# deploy docker

build docker image `$ sudo docker build -t <image name>:<tag> -f <Dockerfile>`

run docker container and mount to your floder `$ sudo docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $PWD:/app --name <container name> <image name>:<tag>`

run docker image with special command `$ sudo docker exec <container name> python3 inference.py`
